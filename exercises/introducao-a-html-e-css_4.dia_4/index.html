        <h2> Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda</h2>
        <p>Two years ago I decided to make the jump from comics to animation. I've been drawing comics for over a decade and wanted to take a stab at creating an animated TV series or film. I eventually found myself at Illumination, the creators of Despicable Me, Minions, Sing , and The Secret Life of Pets. They were fans of The Oatmeal, and I was a fan of Illumination, so it was a happy union. I've been working with them as creative consultant for the past 18 months on a few of their features.</p>
        <p>I started by doing punchup comedy on The Secret life of Pets 2, creating jokes about cats, dogs, and farm animals. Some of these jokes were written in script pages, others were drawn as storyboards. Throughout this process I've learned a ton about screenwriting, filmmaking, and storyboarding. I even taught myself how to make animatics -- animatics are lo-fi cartoons used to prototype a scene, like an animated storyboard.</p>
        <p>I included one of my sample storyboards below, along with the full-CG rendered scene. Working on a movie like this means collaborating with dozens (if not hundreds) of other people, so the process means a lot of tweaks and adjustments to make a scene work. I originally drew this scene with Max, but in working with the filmmakers, it was decided it worked better for the scene with Duke. The final version can be seen in the Rooster Trailer, which I've linked to below.</p>
